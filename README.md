# psychOpenStatsbook

This is my attempt at making an open-access textbook for data research aimed at psychologists. Unlike other textbooks, this will always be free, welcome contributions from anyone (clone this repository and then make pull requests if you have an update you think that would help), and will teach you how to run your analyses using Excel, SPSS, JASP, R and Python!

For now, have a look at previews of the current chapter(s) below:
