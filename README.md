# Open-Streams(OS)-ome Handbook

This will be a handbook how to use Open-Streams to create handbooks that are easy to annotate collaboratively, and publish articles in the future.

## Data analysis
At the moment, there aren't plans to make this a comprehensive statistics book. Thus there'll be a focus on some exemplar statistical tests so that you can see how to complete analyses with a variety of packages and write them up with Open-Streams
